        <h2>UX Design</h2>
        <p> UX Design always happens. Whether itâ€™s intentional or not, somebody makes the decisions about how the human
            and the product will interact. Good UX Design happens when we make these decisions in a way that understands
            and fulfills the needs of both our users and our business. <br>
            A UX Designer is focused on all aspects of a product's development, including design, usability, funcion,
            and
            even branding and marketing. Their work touches the entire end-to-end journey of a user's interaction with a
            product, and includes identifying new opportunities for the product and business.
